# Megasena DApp

In this project I implemented an App using solidity to develop a smart contract and a simple frontend app in react. The main goal was to create a raffle and transact the money using Ethereum test network Ropstein.

# How to execute this project

FIrst you will need a cripto wallet. I used [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). After this you need to deploy your smart contract and get it's address, for this I used the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). After copying the contract address you need to paste it at the src/index.js in the contractAddress variable.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
